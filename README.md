## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **macOS 13.0+** (developed on macOS 26.0.1 beta)
2. **Xcode Command Line Tools** installed
3. **API Keys**:
   - OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
   - ElevenLabs API key ([Get one here](https://elevenlabs.io/))
   - Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)) — optional, for future vision features

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aran-yogesh/TalkBack.git
   cd TalkBack
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**:
   
   Copy the template and add your keys:
   ```bash
   cp config.swift.template config.swift
   ```
   
   Edit `config.swift` with your actual API keys:
   ```swift
   struct Config {
       static let openAIAPIKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
       static let elevenLabsAPIKey = "YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY_HERE"
       static let elevenLabsVoiceID = "cgSgspJ2msm6clMCkdW9"  // Ivanna's voice
       static let geminiAPIKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
   }
   ```
   
   > **Note**: `config.swift` is gitignored so your keys stay local. Never commit real API keys. See [API_KEY_SETUP.md](API_KEY_SETUP.md) for more details.

3. **Compile the app**:
   ```bash
   swiftc -o ConversationalTalkBack ConversationalTalkBack.swift \
     -framework Cocoa -framework Foundation -framework AVFoundation \
     -target arm64-apple-macosx13.0
   ```

4. **Run TalkBack**:
   ```bash
   ./ConversationalTalkBack
   ```

5. **Grant permissions** when prompted:
   - **Microphone** — required for continuous voice listening
   - **Accessibility** — required for Lens Mode (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility)

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Voice Chat

1. **Start the App**: Run `./ConversationalTalkBack`
2. **Grant Microphone Permission**: Allow microphone access when prompted
3. **Just talk** — TalkBack listens continuously. Speak naturally and it will detect when you stop (2-second silence threshold), then transcribe and respond
4. **Listen**: TalkBack responds with Ivanna's voice and attitude
5. **Drag**: Move the avatar anywhere on your screen
6. **Quit**: Drag avatar near the menu bar → drop in trash can

### Lens Mode (Text Analysis)

1. Click the **🔍 menu bar icon** and enable **Lens Mode**, or hold **⌥ Option**
2. Hover your cursor over any on-screen text
3. A floating bubble appears with a preview and action buttons (**Summarize** / **Make Concise**)
4. Click an action to get an AI-powered result in the overlay

> Requires Accessibility permission: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

### 🔥 MCP Code Monitoring (Cursor IDE Integration)

TalkBack can watch your terminal and roast you when your code fails! Here's how:

1. **Start TalkBack** (it automatically monitors `/tmp/talkback_message.json`)

2. **Run your code through the monitor**:
   ```bash
   # Test with a script that has errors (will trigger full roast 🔥)
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run 'python3 your_broken_script.py'
   
   # Test with successful code (will get sassy compliment 💅)
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run 'python3 your_working_script.py'
   
   # Test with any command
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run 'swift your_code.swift'
   ```

3. **TalkBack will roast you based on errors**:
   - ✅ **0 errors**: "Oh wow, it ACTUALLY worked? Color me shocked, darling! 💅✨"
   - 😏 **1 error**: "ONE error? Cute. At least you're almost there, sweetheart. 😏"
   - 🔥 **2+ errors**: "Oh HONEY, what is this hot mess? Did you code this with your eyes closed? 🔥💀"

4. **Example test**:
   ```bash
   # This will trigger a savage roast
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run 'python3 broken_code.py'
   
   # TalkBack will speak the roast with Ivanna's voice!
   ```

## 🎭 Personality

TalkBack is designed to be:
- 😏 **Sassy**: Witty comebacks and attitude-filled responses
- 🎯 **Helpful**: Actually useful advice (hidden in the sass)
- 💁‍♀️ **Pushy**: Won't let you procrastinate
- 🧠 **Smart**: Remembers your conversations
- 🎤 **Talkative**: Loves to chat (maybe too much)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Voice Output?
- Check system volume and audio output device
- Verify ElevenLabs API key and voice ID
- Look for `🎤 ElevenLabs TTS HTTP Status: 200` in terminal

### TalkBack Not Hearing Me?
- Check microphone permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone)
- Look for `✅ Continuous listening started!` in terminal output
- TalkBack won't process audio while it's speaking (to avoid feedback loops)
- Built-in rate limiting: ~22s cooldown between OpenAI calls, ~5s between STT calls

### Rate Limit Errors?
- OpenAI usage limits: Check your account for current limits
- TalkBack has built-in cooldowns (22s for GPT-4o, 5s for STT) to stay within default rate limits
- Add a payment method to your OpenAI account for higher limits

### Missing `config.swift`?
- Copy the template: `cp config.swift.template config.swift`
- Add your API keys to `config.swift`

### Lens Mode Not Working?
- Grant Accessibility permission: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
- Enable Lens Mode via the 🔍 menu bar icon, or hold ⌥ Option
- Text must be at least 12 characters for analysis

### MCP Roasts Not Triggering?
- Ensure TalkBack is running (it polls `/tmp/talkback_message.json` every 0.5s)
- Run commands through the monitor: `python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run "YOUR_COMMAND"`
- Check that `watchdog` is installed: `pip3 install watchdog`

### Crashes on Launch?
- Compile with explicit target: `-target arm64-apple-macosx13.0`
- Check Swift version: `swift --version`
- Beta macOS can be unstable with Speech framework

## 📝 Development Notes

This project was developed on **macOS 26.0.1 beta** with **Swift 6.2**, which required special handling:
- Explicit compilation target (`-target arm64-apple-macosx13.0`)
- Avoided unstable `SFSpeechRecognizer` framework
- Used ElevenLabs STT instead of macOS built-in speech recognition
- Prioritized `NSSound` over `AVAudioPlayer` for better MP3 compatibility
