5. **Use Lens Mode**: Toggle from the menu bar Lens icon or hold ⌥ Option, then hover text and tap **Summarize** or **Make Concise**
6. **Toggle Coding Teacher Mode**: Enable it from the same Lens menu for guided explanations
7. **Drag**: Move the avatar anywhere on your screen
8. **Quit**: Drag avatar near the menu bar → drop in trash can

### 🔥 MCP Code Monitoring (Cursor IDE Integration)

TalkBack can watch your terminal and roast you when your code fails! Here's how:

1. **Start TalkBack** (it automatically monitors `/tmp/talkback_message.json`)

2. **Run your code with the monitor**:
   ```bash
   # Test with a script that has errors (will trigger full roast 🔥)
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run "python3 broken_code.py"
   
   # Test with a single error (light sass 😏)
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run "python3 -c 'print(undefined_var)'"
   
   # Test with successful code (will get sassy compliment 💅)
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run "python3 -c 'print(1)'"
   
   # Test with any command
   python3 cursor_code_monitor.py run "swift your_code.swift"
   ```

3. **TalkBack will roast you based on errors**:
   - ✅ **0 errors**: "Oh wow, it ACTUALLY worked? Color me shocked, darling! 💅✨"
   - 😏 **1 error**: "ONE error? Cute. At least you're almost there, sweetheart. 😏"
   - 🔥 **2+ errors**: "Oh HONEY, what is this hot mess? Did you code this with your eyes closed? 🔥💀"

4. **Optional: send a test MCP message**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_mcp_connection.py
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Voice Output?
- Check system volume and audio output device
- Verify ElevenLabs API key and voice ID
- Look for `🎤 ElevenLabs TTS HTTP Status: 200` in terminal

### Empty Transcriptions?
- Speak clearly and pause for a short silence to finish a request
- Check microphone permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone)
- Verify ElevenLabs API key is valid

### Rate Limit Errors?
- OpenAI usage limits: Check your account for current limits
- Add payment method or wait 20 seconds between requests

### Crashes on Launch?
- Compile with explicit target: `-target arm64-apple-macosx13.0`
- Check Swift version: `swift --version`
- Beta macOS can be unstable with Speech framework

## 📝 Development Notes

This project was developed on **macOS 26.0.1 beta** with **Swift 6.2**, which required special handling:
- Explicit compilation target (`-target arm64-apple-macosx13.0`)
- Avoided unstable `SFSpeechRecognizer` framework
- Used ElevenLabs STT instead of macOS built-in speech recognition
- Prioritized `NSSound` over `AVAudioPlayer` for better MP3 compatibility

## 🔮 Future Features

- [ ] Screen monitoring (detect what user is doing)
- [ ] Context-aware productivity tips
- [ ] Custom voice selection
- [ ] Multiple personality modes
- [ ] Scheduled check-ins
- [ ] Integration with calendar/reminders
