- Ensure you're holding the mouse button while speaking
- Check microphone permissions (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone)
- Verify ElevenLabs API key is valid

### Rate Limit Errors?
- OpenAI free tier: 3 requests per minute
- Add payment method or wait 20 seconds between requests

- Check Swift version: `swift --version`
- Beta macOS can be unstable with Speech framework

## 📝 Development Notes

- Explicit compilation target (`-target arm64-apple-macosx13.0`)
- Avoided unstable `SFSpeechRecognizer` framework
- Used ElevenLabs STT instead of macOS built-in speech recognition
- Prioritized `NSSound` over `AVAudioPlayer` for better MP3 compatibility
